"""
timing_engine.py - Vimshottari dasha/bhukti timing for a KP horary chart.

Convention (as chosen by the project owner):
  * The Moon's position in the chart sets the Vimshottari dasha at the chart moment.
  * A dasha/bhukti "supports" the question when BOTH its Mahadasha lord and its Bhukti lord
    signify at least one POSITIVE house of the question.
  * Each supportive bhukti is subdivided into its 9 antaras (in Vimshottari order, starting
    with the bhukti lord). An antara "supports" when ALL THREE lords (Mahadasha, Bhukti,
    Antara) signify at least one POSITIVE house. Ruling-Planet confirmation works the same
    way: a period is fruitful when at least one of its lords is a Ruling Planet.
  * A planet signifies: the house it occupies, the houses it owns, and the same two things for
    its Star Lord (the KP signification chain, same as the 4 scoring steps).
    Rahu/Ketu own no signs: their ownership is read through their agent (agent_fn).

Pure Python: no swisseph needed. Optional: chart_caster.execute_kp_reading(include_timing=False)
skips this module completely.
